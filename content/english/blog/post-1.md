Hi, my name is Byun Cheolyeon and welcome to my blog

I post daily things, maybe tech related, maybe music composition related, I am not sure myself. Hopefully I'll try and post as much as I can!

## **Brief Self-Introduction**

I'm sure I will include info about myself somewhere else, but I'll include info about myself here too!
My name is Byun Cheolyeon, 27 as of writing this, and I am an aspiring Devops engineer!
I am fully Korean, born and raised there. I studied however in a Japanese University called Waseda located in Shinjuku, Tokyo. 
I ended up learning mostly data science related stuff, with fine tuning language models and whatnot, though frankly I'm almost positive I only every pretended that I understood what the heck those things were about. But it did make me learn that I am quite passionate about tech related stuff, and I ended up getting a job in AWS Ireland! I get to work in their Japanese team, starting April of 2025! Why Ireland and not work in Japan? Well, lots of reasons I guess but, I think the biggest reasons are that,
1. the food in Japan was kinda mid, except for gyudon places like mastuya, those I enjoyed a lot.
2. I get paid more working in Dublin, Ireland. Though I guess that's obvious considering the price of living there is way higher as well.
3. I wanted to English as much as I can, and I do want to end up living in an English speaking country eventually if I can!

## **My Interests**
I am mostly interested in two things right now. Devops, and music writing. Well, for music writing however I just basically got started, and downloaded my first digital audio workstation, namely logic pro on my mac m1. It took me forever to actually get that everything downloaded, especially the additional plugins and instruments and whatnot all totaled to about 70 gb, and my wifi here is just a measly 100 mbps. Measly just because I live in Seoul, and the only two good things about living in Seoul is that the internet is pretty quick and the food here is great. Other than that Seoul is a cesspool with people that become mentally derange psychopaths whenver they take the steering wheel, and are so eager to be mad at somebody whenver they get the chance. I'm half joking, but also half serious.
In any case, hopefully my music writing hobby will actually be a thing I can do for a long time instead of me ditching it after a month.
Also, about devops. This is my current interest, mainly because I will be working as a cloud support engineer in AWS Ireland, and anything cloud related, kubernetes related, and devops related is all related to my line of work. Which is why I am currently studying for the CKA exam, and I'm taking this course on udemy from this guy called Mumshad because it was on sale, and apparently it is the go-to course for people learning Kubernetes. 

## **More about Music**
I was always interested in making music. I remember one of my earliest memories being that of me listening to the music of howl's moving castle and princess mononoke, both ghibli films, and feeling like these music is just out of this world, stunning, stellar, and other adjectives you can surely look up on thesaurus.
Unfortunately I never had the commitment to actually sit down and learn music composition. I don't think making music needs to be done after you're a master of music composition, but it sure does help! In fact it's just a skill like any other. If you diligently learning music composition, it's not gonna make you the next John Williams, Yoko Kanno, Hisaishi Joe, Koji Kondo (yes the guy that made mario music, even the original mario theme that everybody knows, this guy made!) but you sure as hell ain't gonna be creating music if you mope around saying you dont have talent! I'm sure there exists people that was capable of making music without any real commitment to learning music theory, but like many other skills in life, if that deters to learn music to the point where you're discouraged and don't wanna compose at all, well then obviously you're not gonna be better at composing any time soon. 
All this talk makes me seem like I am super committed to this whole music thing, but unfortunately I wsa never serious about it either. I wasted about 10 years, just watching a 10 minute music theory video, feeling satisfied not actually creating music. Well, hopefully things will change now that I have my logic pro with me.

## **DAW**
By the way if you own an apple device, like me with my mac m1, chances are you've heard great things about the logic pro, including myself. I do think that logic pro will be a satisfying app, but I am thinking about weighing my options betweeen two DAWs, the logic pro, and Reaper. Frankly the number one thing I care about when I buy anything is the money. Unless if I'm buying any pokemon goods. Pokemon goods burn a hole in my wallet like nothing else.
Back to DAWs, Reaper is great on mac too, and it costs $60 for the cheaper license. Logic Pro costs $200. I am trying out the logic pro for 90 days since Oct 17th so let's see if the logic pro truly is as good as people say it is!

## **Type of music I'll compose**
I have no earthly idea what I will be composing. Frankly I don't think I'll ever reach that point of musical genius where I get musical inspiration from just taking a walk like some musicians have said they get. But if I had to choose a genre, it will be something akin to the following list of music. These are just lists of music that I listen on a daily basis, so my music will probably resemble these a lot. If you're looking for a genre, I don't think I have any one genre in mind, but I think the best answer is video game music. Though calling that a genre sounds a bit off, since video games are a medium. I guess people do use the term movie soundtracks and video game soundtracks as a genre but... maybe I'm technically wrong, I don't know. In any case, the following is a list of music I enjoy, which are mostly from video games.
- Sonic Mania, Mirage Saloon Act 2 (my favorite as of 2024, a bona fide banger ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥)
- Chrono Trigger, 1. Secret of the Forst, 2. Corridors of Time
- Maplestory, 1. Raindrop Flowers, 2. Temple of time
- The legend of Zelda Echoes of Wisdom, Field 0 ([This one is a little hard to find](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GNiH9nrPkA&ab_channel=Daki097))
- The legend of Zelda Link's Awakening for Switch, Sword Search theme (another banger)
- Yoko Kanno's music, 1. Cowboy Bebop, Tank! 2. Tower of Babel (from album "The Creation", or in Japanese "å¤©åœ°å‰µé€ ") 3. A Guitar's Rhythm ([Another hard one to find, this is from a children's game only available in Japan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U8lPlTK02I&ab_channel=biggs))
- Deltarune, 1. Rude Buster, 2. Field of hopes and dreams
- Undertale, 1. Dating Start! (otherwise known as Alpharad Sponsorship segment music), 2. Tem Shop, 3. Ghost fight, 4. The shop theme
- Shovel Knight 1. An Underlying problem
- Megaman, any of them really
- Megaman X, 1. Zero appears 2. Storm Eagle 3. Sigma stage 1?
- Megaman X5, 1. [Laser Lab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfMNzUv6loE&list=PLokIXPU70elu82WnL58Qz7l6A_oAj7lfo&index=10&ab_channel=Danimajunior) 2. [Sigma Stage 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYrxmo1jt8s&list=PLokIXPU70elu82WnL58Qz7l6A_oAj7lfo&index=28&ab_channel=Danimajunior)
- Pokemon Gold and Silver, 1. National Park 2. Surf theme
- Pokemon Diamond and Pearl, 1. Lake theme 2. Route 203
- Pokemon Black and White 2, Aspertia City

Let's end it there. So if any of you recognize some of the music I wrote there, yeah I am intending on writing something out of those games, or maybe just some completely different type of music like some jazz tunes perhaps. Why jazz? Well I wanted to learn piano, and a lot of piano tutorials just teaches you about jazz tunes so... I just naturally started to learn about Jazz a little. So I do want to be able to solo over a simple jazz chord progression. I came across a nice little video explaning alt chords, that also gives you a chord progression to work with too! [It's this video, although it is in Korean :P](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxLymRgGssc&t=470s&ab_channel=mmjj_)

Well, maybe someday I will finish my own song and post it here maybe! Or maybe I will be moping around instead, who knows!
