This here is the script that I am planning on using for a youtube video idea of mine!

## Youtube Video?
I have always adored the idea of doing a story telling youtube channel, the likes of JaidenAnimation, IceCreamSandwich, Theodd1sout and etc. I think I am a little late to the party, but I have always imagined myself doing one of those, mainly because I like talking about things and also i think I'm a decent conversationalist, for an introvert.
The only problem is my complete lack of drawing skills. Right now I am considering using just a free and open source app called GIMP to be able to draw a few things. Not something as fancy as an "Animation", but just a sequence of drawings, which will look pretty gross and stuff but my goal right now is to actually just do things.
If there is one thing that I learned from self-learning music for 10 years, is that you don't magically get better unless if you actually start DOING things. 

## What is it that you do right now then?
As a brief intro, I am Byun Cheolyeon and I am a Korean, 27 years old as of 2024. Right now I am in quite a comfortable spot in my life, because I already secured myself a position in a company that I wanted to join, but my job officially starts at April of 2025. So I have roughly 5 months as of today, to try and do some fun stuff! One of which will be my youtube gig!

## Story-telling animator
I would bet you have seen one of those animation youtuber videos drawing animations and telling stories about themselves, and getting 7 gajillion views. I enjoy money and fame above all else, so this seemed like a pretty sweet gig. Obviously I'm joking, well, maybe half joking. But the bigger reason why I want to become a story-telling animator/youtuber is because, well, I think I'm pretty good at talking. By talking, I mean things like small talk, getting to know a person, maybe make some jokes are very hit-and-miss, and etc.

## Oh? You're good at talking?
Yeah I believe I do! Or at the very least, I enjoy talking a lot.
Which is kind of funny because, I'm an introvert. But some people have a hard time believing me. If you want proof, here's one! _video: (pull up image of my mbti)
Here is some scientific, empirical evidence that I am an introvert. My MBTI is a ISTP. If you know your MBTIs, you might already be scared to the bones because ISTPs are basically sociopaths. Nah I'm just kidding, kind of. So I am 91% introverted the last time I took the test. And also, the only thing I ever do is being a homebody, not leaving my room for 7 years unless if I have school or work, and watch youtube.
So I enjoy solitude, but the funny thing is I super like talking to people! Which is kind of an unfortunate penchant / characteristic of mine to like talking with people, since I also enjoy being alone more than anything. So now as an introvert who likes talking, but have no friends, the only natural solution that came to mind was obviously to create youtube videos and start talking there!

## Ok well, what are you gonna talk about?
Well, just daily things and my opinions and stuff probably.
I am planning on making my content be related to music producing!
Right now I have only been trying out a DAW for like 2 weeks, so I don't think I am qualified to make those music composing videos yet, but hopefully I'll get there soon, and maybe I'd be able to compose music for my own videos soon as well!
For my first video, I am planning on making a video about my top 10 favorite music ever! I don't think this type of top 10 videos really need any animations really, but boy do I really want to make this video! Video game music is a topic that will never grow old on me, so I would truly feel super happy if I get to make my video on top 10 video game music!
I am concerned about, the monetization aspect of it, specifically about how if I use already existing music, it will get copyright striked or something and I cannot monetize my videos? Which, I know, is a pretty premature thing to be worried about when I don't even have my official channel yet, but you know I think it's a good thing to keep in mind. One advice I have heard from the web is that you can technically recreate songs using my DAW to just use different sound fonts or instrumentations, and just make the same song and use that, and since it is technically yours you can get away with copyright strikes apparently. So maybe I'll de-rust 

## What to expect from your videos?
A good reference that I think I will use on my own, and a good one for you to use as a video that will look similar as mine, is this channel I recently found called [cooper galanis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGiDmmo34BQ&ab_channel=coopergalanis). His artstyle is pretty simple, something I am trying to accomplish, or rather the only thing I am able to accomplish, and he's a great storyteller, so expect my content to feel just like his! Other animation / story-teller youtube channels that I am a big fan of, are [jaiden animations](https://www.youtube.com/@jaidenanimations) and [ice cream sandwich](https://www.youtube.com/@IceCreamSandwich) which have way better animations, so my videos will no where near have the quality of their videos, but I want to maybe get to their level someday!
