there are a few topics that i am thinking about covering...
1. my past / childhood + lovelife
I realized that my past and my lovelife will probably overlap anyhow so

2. adhd!
3. korean mom / asian mom stereotypes
4. top 10 favorite music! 
all of them are pretty good ngl
maybe i should start with my childhood?
but thats kinda like boring esp since i already touched upon my childhood a little already? so yeah maybe i should go for adhd!

# Title of video - i hate my brain
## background about my recent endeavors into identifying why i have problems concentrating
I have adhd. Or at least, i have very strong suspicions that I do. 
Why? Mainly because I could not concentrate in class.
_gag: viewer "just stfu dude, everybody has concentration issues!", i make frightened face,
yes thats fair thats fair, i absolutely dont think im gonna persuade anyone that I have adhd, just because i have issues focusing. Cuz who doesnt?
Whenever I told my friends that I think I have adhd, all goes something like that too,
_gag: yeah man so, i think i have adhd because i cant concentrate at all. my friend goes "thats the only reason why?" I go "yeah", and my friend slaps me in the face and opens up my brain, and notice that my brain is just overheating and smoke is coming out of head. my friend goes "nah your fine. so stop whining you little bit--", and cuts off.

I wasnt able to persuade any of my friends that i had adhd. So lets see if I can at least persuade you guys, the viewers, about the reason why I have an imbalance of brain chemicals!
PLAY_INTRO


But also, classes get difficult right at that time in general, so it wasnt just me who couldnt concentrate I think, which is why I didnt think much of it.

Idk about you guys that went to school on other countries, but in Korea, once you reach 4th grade, your considered like, an upper-class student. The teachers would tell you about the fact that your now pretty close to being a middle school student, and that you guys are on the verge of becoming adults. And this is also when classes starts to get more complicated and your grades starts to decline. But also, classes get difficult right at that time in general, so it wasnt just me who couldnt concentrate I think, so I wasnt suspecting adhd at all. I always just thought this was because, either I wasnt studying hard enough, or because classes were just too difficult for me. Either way, I never suspected an imbalance in my brain chemicals, namely adhd, at all. By the time I became a high school student, thats when I slowly started to realize that, my concentration is faulty. What do I mean by that, well, here are the symptoms that made me have strong suspicions that I had adhd. The biggest symptom, was concentration. Now, I know that almost every single one of you all probably had some concentration issues in the past. I mean, Ive never met a single person that said "yeah actually my concentration is just off the charts at all times so I can concentrate on any given task without flaw"ything like adhd imbalance in my brain chemicalsto 
Everyone has problems concentrating, and yet here I am telling you guys that I suspect that I have adhd simply because I have problems concentrating...Well here's what I mean. When listening to a lecture, more often than not, I will find myself incapable of focusing on the lecture, for even 5 seconds. After just 5 seconds of me trying my absolute fucking best to listen to the person talking, I will start thinking about other shit. And the biggest problem is that this happens, constantly...UNLESS if i am REALLY interested in a subject, which basically never fucking happens as a high school or university student, lets be real. And when im reading books, I would be stuck reading the same line over and over and OVER again for like, 10 minutes, until I finally actually snap back to reality and think "oh i was lost in my train of thought again", and actually read the line.
so usually what happens is, whenever i need to concentrate on anything, my brain lets me focus for maybe a few minutes, and if my brain wants to be even more of an asshole than usual, which it often does, it lets me focus for 10 seconds, and then i start thinking about other shit. and so on average, it would take me 10 times the amount of time for me to just learn some stupid fucking fact or read a single paragraph off a book.
Other animation youtubers like icecreamsandwich and jaidenanimations made amazing videos about adhd and their symptoms, so I would definitely check those out too if your seeking more info on adhd experiences.
For me, my symptoms honestly only have to do with concentration, as opposed to other people with adhd that doesnt just have concentration issues, but also suffers from issues like time management, lack of motivation, depression and stuff.

Now you might be asking, "what the fuck kind of thing do you constantly think about then?". And im glad you asked because i have actually tried to see for myself, what all the things I end up thinking about are, and it could literally be anything, but here are the most common ones. Oh and also i guess todays video wont be too kid friendly so yeah, kids out there watching these vids, you have been warned. So, here all the thoughts that my brains keeps coming up with whenever I try to concentrate.
1. arguments I had with friends that i had in the past and coming up with better rebuttals
2. having sex, so libido.
3. catchy music that just starts playing in my head
4. ideas for a gag to use in my videos, or my music.
5. thinking about how to translate one word in one language to another
6. completely random thoughts, or feelings. by feelings, i mean the feeling of nostalgia or feeling of anger, and all those potent emotions, I would just randomly feel sometimes for no rhyme or reason.

these were some of the common ones, but it really could be about anything.
But what really matters about these random thoughts are that, it keeps coming up in my head in random intervals.
as I am writing this script right now, i got one kpop song that is stuck in my head, and after a few minutes of concentrating, now I have this song just playing in my head, and i just start humming alongside it. btw the song im referring to is 살짝설렜어나. 

because of these symptoms, my grades when i was in middle school, were abysmal. im talking like, a lot of Cs, Ds, and Fs. Once I got to high school, my grades got better basically because I actually tried to become better and put a lot of time into studying, and I ended up getting a lot of B+ and A-. 
Now you might be wondering, "sounds to me like your exaggerating your symptoms then, a lot of people with adhd struggle with grades and you seem like you did fine". and I do think that, my symptoms alone will probably not persuade anybody into thinking that I have adhd, esp with decent grades, but I do also think that, studying in high school comes down to short term memory, and I just had to spend more time memorizing things.

## My symptoms, explained a little further
i think the biggest problem with my symptoms is that, I am not able to retain all information that someone gives to me. So for example when a professor tells us the deadline for our assignments, or your boss tells you a deadline for your task, there is a very good chance that I wasnt paying attention when that info was given, and for normal people with a job, this really is not a big deal, unless that person is having a really rough day or something. 

~~i might not add this part~~
You might be asking though, "just ask one more time about the deadline if you didnt catch it then idiot"
and you would be right, but also I do think that just asking about deadline constantly or asking about whether the way i understand a task is correct or not, when done repeteadly, probably will hurt my reputation slowly. im not saying this alone will be a cause people to think im incapable, but if I were a manager that wants to promote somebody, i would probably give it to someone that is able to not ask about deadlines constantly.


## ADHD Meds
so i decided to get medicated for my concentration issues. but getting adhd medication in Korea is actually kind of more complex than compared to other countries like Japan, cuz in Japan I was just able to get adhd medication after filling out a paper form that took me 30 minutes to fill. In Korea on ther other hand, apparently people have been trying to get their hands on adhd meds because people thought it was some magical pill that increases concentration, so its harder to get your hands on them. Because of this, I was basically asked to provide more info about my young self, specifically i was asked to provide my (생활기록부) school records, but not because they want to see my grades, but because they want to see what my homeroom teachers had to say about me. Which honestly, i seriously doubt the authenticity of this kind procedure. Mainly because, if I do have adhd like I assume I do, I have the inattentive type of adhd. Which is to say that, you would not see me be hyperactive physically. instead, you might see me just sitting quietly, and you might see me make eye contact with you, making people believe that i am paying attention, when in reality i am often times just completely lost in my own train of thoughts, so the hyperactivity is happening in my brain and isnt projected physically through my body.
so, what happens next when the doctor sees my school records that probably just contain records about me that goes something like, "he's a nice but quiet kid with average grades", do I think the doc will be able to know that I have adhd from looking at those half ass records? No, prolly not. 
## School records
so i just actually was able to get my hands on the school records online from the Korean government website, and I only had to go through some authenticating and that was about it, which is one great thing about Koreans is that we usually do not like wasting our time. Anyways getting to see my own school records was honestly pretty friggin entertaining. i got to see my own picture when I was in elementary school and in middle school, or i guess for you 'muriacans its primary and secondary school. I actually physically had to shout at my own pictures because of how I looked ngl. When I do my face reveal video Im thinking I should definitely share my pics when i was young too so...yeah def hit that subscribe button haha <3 
So after checking out my school records, I noticed that, besides my horrible grades I had when I was in middle school (secondary school) between age 13 to 15, there was no real indication that my homeroom teachers wrote about my concentration. They mentioned things about, how im a nice kid but requires more diligence, how I seem to be capable but lacks grit and perseverance...all that kinda of stuff. But one of my homeroom teachers, the one I had in grade 9, that teacher actually did write in my school record how I seem to "lack concentration". I was pretty surprised knowing that there even was a teacher that analyzed me well enough to even realize that I did lack concentration. Normally I would imagine my homeroom teachers would just write down something like, hes a nice and quiet kid that seems to be smart, or something like that. I guess I did have really low grades at grade 9, but instead saying that I lacked perseverance and diligence like the other teachers, my grade 9 teacher actually wrote that I seem to lack focus. Dang I guess some teachers really do pay attention to their students.
So in any case, the chances of me getting adhd medication in Korea went from, not likely to, a maybe? thanks to my grade 9 teacher, so 김성안 선생님 감사합니다! ...though I seriously doubt she'll even come across this video 

## back toADHD meds
So back to ADHD meds. For me I kinda got lucky that I even found a record from school that mentions my lack of concentration at all. But this procedure to just get adhd medication still feels like its pretty stupid, and its there to make it harder for people to get meds. And its pretty much all thanks to a bunch of Korean assholes that would want to get adhd meds thinking that its some magical pill that guarantees better concentration.
honestly if there was a better way of figuring out if people have adhd or not i would def try that shit out. According to the one doctor I talked to recently in Korea, he said that there are no tests that works like a MRI scan, that can just tell you immeidately if you had adhd or not? But I distinctly remember how icecreamsandwich said something about a brain scan that actually do just that, tell you if you have adhd and shit. But when I asked this doctor, he said no there is no such thing, not even other countries like the US...?? and thats when I started seriously doubt this doctor cuz he kinda seemed like hes just making shit up now.
after some researching online, the brain scan that icecreamsandwich talked about is called an EEG test, and its a test that can help diagnose adhd, but some studies show cast some doubts on its legitimacy? So... maybe the doctor isnt completely wrong?
But whatever, the point is that, for me to get meds right now, I need to show him my stupid school records.
and you know what happened after I showed him my school records? He did end up giving me the meds...fucking finally.

So now I am taking concerta, which is supposed to be a stimulant. There are two major adhd meds that you can acquire in Korea as of 2024, one is concerta, a stimulant med, and the other is straterra, which is a non-stimulant like vyvanse which is more mellow. so a non-stimulant tends to have less side effects but might take longer for the effects to start showing up. Concerta does still release its juice within a longer time span compared to something like adderall. And of course adderall is banned in Korea since it is very similar to meth and in Korea basically any drugs with the slightest chance of abusing are usually not available.

Ive only recently started taking concerta so, and so far it doesnt have an effect at all, making me think that maybe it really isnt adhd that I have, and is instead just me being just being a person that gets easily distracted with a short attention span. Which would also make perfect sense, and all I want is to just be able to fix my problem of concentration which Im sure will bite me in the ass pretty hard once i start to work in an actual company.
