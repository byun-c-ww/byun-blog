there are a few topics that i am thinking about covering...
1. my past / childhood + lovelife
I realized that my past and my lovelife will probably overlap anyhow so

2. adhd!
3. korean mom / asian mom stereotypes
4. top 10 favorite music! 
all of them are pretty good ngl
maybe i should start with my childhood?
but thats kinda like boring esp since i already touched upon my childhood a little already? so yeah maybe i should go for adhd!

# Title of video - i hate my brain
## Intro
I hate my brain.
i wish i could just grab my brain and shoot it
_gag0: grab and then shoot my brain 
why? beucz this mfer cannot concentrate for the life of me
to the point where I now have strong suspicions that I have ADHD.
## background about my recent endeavors into identifying why i have problems concentrating
_gag1: viewer "yeah everybody has trouble concentrating dude...", i say "no, i swear its different!"
yeah..., i absolutely dont think im gonna persuade anyone that I have adhd, just because i have issues focusing. Cuz who doesnt?
Whenever I told my friends that I think I have adhd, it all went something like this,
_gag2: yeah man so, i think i have adhd because i really struggle with concentrating. my friend goes "thats the only reason why?" I go "basically yes", and my friend slaps me in the face and opens up my brain, and notice that my brain is just overheating and smoke is coming out of head. my friend goes "your fine. so stop whining like a little bit--", and cuts off.

so I wasnt able to persuade any of my FRIENDS about it, So lets see if I can at least persuade you guys, the viewers, about the reason why I think I have ADHD, justifying my hatred towards this pink stinking gumball in my head
PLAY_INTRO
so people with adhd exhibits hyperactivity and issues with concentrating. And there exists two different types. ~~other animation youtubers like icecreamsandwich and jaidenanimation made fantastic videos about adhd where I got to learn about this stuff. the 2 types are, The inattentive type, and then the hyperactive type, and I have the inattentive type. So I might seem like a normal kid on the surface thats just kinda quiet all the time, but actually there is still a lot of hyperactivity going on, but its just happening inside my head.~~ 
The inattentive type, and then the hyperactive type. btw i learned these from icecreamsandwiches video on adhd, so check that shit out. for me, I suspect I have the inattentive type of adhd. People with this type may seem theyre paying attention sitting quiety lin class, when in reality they think about other shit constantly.
gag3: a teacher asks "any questions?", I just go "..." and the teachers goes "he seems like hes paying attention. hes making eye contact with me just fine too", and then in my head im actually, playing the super mario theme?
or maybe the carton of milk falling from spongebob?

but a lot of ppl has that kind of issue. what differentiates me with those people? Its the fact that, for me this happens WAY too often. How often? prolly 80% of the time. Whenver I need my brain to learn or listen to a lecture or do perform any task, I get distracted by my own thoughts and thoughts derail SO EASILY.  
And unless if I am really REALLY interested in the thing I am working on already, i WILL 100% get distracted. So 80% of the time I need to focus, I get distracted everytime.
gag4: is the 80& of the time, i get distracted everytime thing, will be the gag here

What are these random thoughts that keeps on distracting me? well, I compiled a list of some of the most common "random thoughts I have"! By the way this list might not be so kid friendly so kids who are watching this right now, you guys have been warned!!
_video: just a nsfw warning

1. having sex, so libido.
this one, is the bane of my existence. I HATE how whenver I do literally ANYTHING, doesnt matter what your doing, i could be cleaning the dishes or watching youtube videos, or studying, and the thought of having intercourse would randomly pop into my head. what usually happens is, whenver I need to think think about anything, AS SOON AS a wamen is involved in that thought of mine, my brain blares the alarm cuz its an opportunity to start thinking about sex.
gag5: i see an ad with a wamen on it, and i go "no...please resist the temptation you stupid ass brain" and my brain is like "hey its a wamen...SOUND THE ALARAM!!" and then cut back to me with my eyes thats all voided out
2. number2, arguments i had in the past
this is such a classic one. Im sure a lot of you have had that experience of having an argument, and coming up with the perfect comeback for that argument, 2 weeks later when your taking a shower. I had one argument pretty recently that I just cannot get over and roll off my back for the life of me, despite the fact that it really is not a big deal. And i think talking about that argument will make me go a bit insane so lets move on.
gag6: just show images of me cleaning the dishes, then my eyes black out and i start thinking abot the argument. Then you do the same thing with me in the shower, me on bed, and me while im working. the last scene, i think im just gonna write "i hate my brain"
3. => stupid things i have done in the past!!!
this shit happens all the time too....my brain is SUCH a fan of reminding me about my failure in the past. like dumb things i said, awkward social interactions... and ive said a LOT of dumb things in the past, all thanks to me not paying attention too many times. So my FRIGGIN brain fails to retain information correctly, and then it starts to REMIND me of embarassing times I misinform people... what a bag of dicks this brain of mine...god damn ....
gag7: i guess ill just use images of me telling people "yeah he didnt mention any deadlines" and then turns out there was... and im all like "SHIT"... and years later my brain is like, "oh my god you were so fucking stupid that one time what the fuck is wrong with you! LOL"... and im like "I will body slam you BRAIN". and then my brain in the next scene is like "uh...but how?"
and then maybe I will add a final scene of me throwing my brain to the ground, and then me blue screening?

4. succeedding in life, like great successses like being a god tier programmer or hitting 1 million subs on youtube
this is also a pretty good one. I often find myself thinking about being a god tier pro-gamer, a god tier programmer, or a god tier music composer, or a youtuber with 1 million subs...so just any type of success in life, I often imagine myself having. 
and this also includes succeeding in overcoming my adhd!! oh the irony.
so in a way, my adhd loves reminding me of the idea of overcoming itself??
The main cause of the problem is telling me that I need to fix the problem...how annoying
so its like 
gag8: my adhd brain teases me with is wobbly arms, and say "ooooh you wanna try and fix me up so badly dont you ooooh maybe you should do sth about it then teehee cuz if you dont ill keep on teasing you about it oooh!" and I bring a bazooka and try to blast it, but it was all just part of my daydream (which is reusing the same clip from intro, but this time ill try and double the play speed)
5. catchy music that just starts playing in my head
this one also happens a LOT.  Im a personal fan of a lot of nintendo music, and video game music in general so thats what I usually play in my head.
gag9: i play animal crossing music, and i bop my head for 5 solid seconds... and the professor asks
"byun, this time tell me about how lstm and RNN is able to retain information long term and how they differ in their approach to remember long term."
and i just go "나비보벳따우" and teacher goes "thats a banger ngl"
Now other random thoughts I have are,
6. thinking about how to translate one word in one language to another
gag11 (used number 9 in recording): how do you say "주례" in English...oh its called "wedding officiant scripts / wedding ceremony scripts"? interesting
mention the fact that this happened while i was writing my script, then my mom enters my room really hard and she goes
"when can i see my grandkids??" and I go "no mom im gonna make a video about you next time! not now!"
7. completely random thoughts, or feelings. Yeah, sometimes I would just feel certain...feelings and then my imagination would go WILD off of these feelings. its a little hard to explain, an example is, the feeling of nostalgia or feeling of anger, and all those types of potent emotions. So for example if that emotion is nostalgia, my brain first starts off with randomly feeling nostalgic, and THEN my brain would remind me of past experiences that made me feel nostalgic, OR it could also give me fake imaginary scenarios that would potentially make me feel nostalgic...
heres a quick example. my mind just gave one really random imaginary scenario, while I was writing this script, that makes me feel kind of angry i guess? I was imagining myself living with a girl, and while i was sitting on my chair, that girl approached me and shaves my head in one fell swoop. And thats it...yeah i know my fucking mind is truly an enigma. 
video: maybe ill just add in some serene back ground with calming music...then cut to me with blacked out eyes indicating my thoughts are hyperactive

## why i hate my brain
And THIS, this tendency of my brain to start, throwing things to contemplate over, throwing things to think and feel about, 70 million times a day, THIS is the reason why I absolutely HATE my brain. A good analogy I think is, as if your brain is an alter ego. like your brain has a mind of its own??
gag12 (used number 10 in recording): the brain says "...but i am your mind...we share the same mind...wat??"
gag13: my brain is dumb founded, and overheats
im Not sure if that makes a lot of sense. The point is that, I dont have control over my brain at all. And as SOON as there is nothing in front of me right now that grabs MY attention, then my brain takes over the wheel, and makes ME think about whatever my BRAIN wants! And usually whatever my brain WANTS to think about are completely fucking random!
gag13.5 (but used number 11 for recording): i am trying to read a book, and says out loud "alrighty lets read this thing..." then my brain is like "hey... you know what'll actually be more useful in life? some socializing skills becuz you suck at socializikng pretty hard... judging from past experiences, wouldn't you agree?" and then a small miniature figure of mine appears next to my brain which is supposed to be my own mind? it tells my brain "uh... no i just wanna read this book right now" but then zooms out to reveal me with grey eyes and im like "yeah...i should maybe go learn more about sociazling right now..." 
and then maybe ill add one bit where my brains says "and also i think we should watch some porn..." and then cuts off immdeiately

~~And this is what made me take so much god damn time learning something when I dont super care about it. and lets be real, a student that really cares about learning things, when they're forced to learn it like in school, is PRETTY rare., which made me struggle pretty hard getting good grades in school, becuz I didnt give a dong about math and history when I had to learn it in order to go get good grades in school. Other things like deadlines for assignments, I had trouble with too, cuz there was a good chance I WAS not paying attention when the deadline was mentioned, unless if it was written somewhere where I can easily notice.~~
my experience going to school ever since the age of 10, ALL wnet something like this.
I go to class, I just stay quiet pretending like im paying attention by sometimes making eye contact with the teacher / professor, when in reality I would actually be paying attention only 10% of the time, and the class is finished. In a 90 minute class, Id be focusing for 10, or even 5 minutes sometimes, while the rest is spent thinking about random unrelated things.
gag14: every random thought i covered like "arguments" "embarassing past" "succeeding in life" "catchy music"
they all start fighting and be like "Im gonna take control of the brain", "no Im gonna do that"
and then libido comes bust the door open in the brain and hes like "everybody stfu" 
~~And I KNOW this will start causing me a lot of headache later down the line when I actually start to work, which is why I finally decided that, I need professional help, and get medication.~~
~~so in my part 2 video on adhd ill share my experiences getting diagnosis from a psychiatrist and potentially getting medication!~~

outro:
hey thanks for watching. So, just as a disclaimer, i dont think I 100% have adhd, i just suspect that something is going on in my head, and that something might just be adhd. So I am planning on visiting a psychiatrist and potentially getting medicated, and make a part 2 video about my brain again. So yeah! thank you all for watching.


## Medication
Getting adhd meds in Korea is I believe a bit harder compared to other countries, because ONE, people used to misuse these meds, esp students who thought adhd meds are magical meds that helps concentration, even for ppl without adhd. TWO, meds like adderrall that is a close relative of meth is banned completely because anything that even resembles recreational drugs in this country is strictly prohibited. Not to say that adderall is basically meth, i think its supposed to be a bit more complicated than that? All i care is that, adderall seems to work great as adhd meds, and I would have taken it too if i could only get my hads on one.

In any case, because of those reasons, doctors deliberately made it so it is a bit harder to get yourself diagnosed with ADHD. So when I visited a psychiatrist near me, I filled in a form that made me answer a series of questions, where I had to answer with a number between 1 to 6 to see how severe my inability to concentrate and stuff. After I filled out the form, the doctor basically said, yeah you might have adhd, but I cant jump to conclusions just yet, so I need you to print your school records and give it to me in order to get a better understanding of you.

Now... I honestly dont like this... I get why doctors would make me do this, since people have been misusing it here in Korea and stuff, but I seriously doubt my school records is really gonna give me a good indication of me having adhd. Beucase like I said I have the inattentive type of adhd, and all I really expect to see from my school records is shit like "oh hes a good, quiet kid thats kind but also needs to work harder on his grades" type of typical commentary from the homeroom teachers. What exactly happens for a quiet kid with adhd that did work hard for his grades and had decent grades? The doctor mentioned that he doesnt care about the grades, and thats not what hes trying to look at, but EVEN THEN, do i really expect the homeroom teachers to KNOW that a kid with decent grades have problems concentrating? NO. I actually had horrible grades when I was in middle school, but do I expect the teachers to mention a single line about how I might lack the ability to focus? No, chances seem pretty slim. So I am pretty bummed out at that point since I was pretty sure that I wont be able to get my meds...

Whatever let me just print out my school records here....
_gag14: the paper is printing out the printer... and Im still talking here.
By the way, if you live in Korea, you can find your school records from our government's website right away. And one good thing about living in Korea is that, tedious tasks like finding some document to print from a governments website, which involves authenticating yourself online, all these things are can be achieve with just a couple of minutes. The whole bureaucratic process here in Korea can be extremely quick and not tedious, and so thats one pretty awesome thing living in Korea.
_gag15: paper is done printing
alright so lemme see here...though i seriously doubt any of my teachers mentioned that I lack concentration...
WAIT a sec it does??
Turns out, my homeroom teacher from grade 9, actually DID mention that I seem to lack concentration...WHAT
so now my odds of getting meds increased a whole lot I believe.
감사합니다 김성안 선생님! 사랑합니다!!
i have never felt any type of gratitude towards a Korean teacher or professor ever in my life, not even once,
but this one time I finally feel a sense of gratitude... lol 
so yeah, will I be able to get my hands on those sweet drugs?? stay tuned...for my part 2 video where I will share with you guys how the whole adhd me business worked out, and I will share with you my experiences taking adhd meds!
also for all the new subscribers I had and all the vieweres and all the people that left wonderful comments, thank you so much, I am super enjoying learning to draw things, and making music for my youtube videos and stuff,  interacting with you guys, its all super fun and I am hoping i can keep doing that in the coming years so, yeah thank you guys all so mcuh <3 (maybe show my garbage animation of me throwing a kiss)

## Outro
thanks for watching. By the way, i do want to mention that, adhd meds arent the only solution, you can try out mindfulness exercises too. What I would do is I would sit down for 15 minutes, and I would catch myself whenever I feel my thoughts are derailing. but dont think of it as exercise to make you "stop thinking", but rather think of it as just "catching your own random thoughts when it first pops into your head, identify it and just acknolwedge that it popped up in your head, until it goes away" and that definitely helped me out with mindfulness, thought i have not been doing this exercise consistently so... I should probably try doing it more before I lecture you guys about it XD
in any case, next videos are going to be about adhd part 2, and my asian mom! so keep your eyes out for those videos! 안녕히가세요!

------- old script starts here

But also, classes get difficult right at that time in general, so it wasnt just me who couldnt concentrate I think, which is why I didnt think much of it.

Idk about you guys that went to school on other countries, but in Korea, once you reach 4th grade, your considered like, an upper-class student. The teachers would tell you about the fact that your now pretty close to being a middle school student, and that you guys are on the verge of becoming adults. And this is also when classes starts to get more complicated and your grades starts to decline. But also, classes get difficult right at that time in general, so it wasnt just me who couldnt concentrate I think, so I wasnt suspecting adhd at all. I always just thought this was because, either I wasnt studying hard enough, or because classes were just too difficult for me. Either way, I never suspected an imbalance in my brain chemicals, namely adhd, at all. By the time I became a high school student, thats when I slowly started to realize that, my concentration is faulty. What do I mean by that, well, here are the symptoms that made me have strong suspicions that I had adhd. The biggest symptom, was concentration. Now, I know that almost every single one of you all probably had some concentration issues in the past. I mean, Ive never met a single person that said "yeah actually my concentration is just off the charts at all times so I can concentrate on any given task without flaw"ything like adhd imbalance in my brain chemicalsto 
Everyone has problems concentrating, and yet here I am telling you guys that I suspect that I have adhd simply because I have problems concentrating...Well here's what I mean. When listening to a lecture, more often than not, I will find myself incapable of focusing on the lecture, for even 5 seconds. After just 5 seconds of me trying my absolute fucking best to listen to the person talking, I will start thinking about other shit. And the biggest problem is that this happens, constantly...UNLESS if i am REALLY interested in a subject, which basically never fucking happens as a high school or university student, lets be real. And when im reading books, I would be stuck reading the same line over and over and OVER again for like, 10 minutes, until I finally actually snap back to reality and think "oh i was lost in my train of thought again", and actually read the line.
so usually what happens is, whenever i need to concentrate on anything, my brain lets me focus for maybe a few minutes, and if my brain wants to be even more of an asshole than usual, which it often does, it lets me focus for 10 seconds, and then i start thinking about other shit. and so on average, it would take me 10 times the amount of time for me to just learn some stupid fucking fact or read a single paragraph off a book.
Other animation youtubers like icecreamsandwich and jaidenanimations made amazing videos about adhd and their symptoms, so I would definitely check those out too if your seeking more info on adhd experiences.
For me, my symptoms honestly only have to do with concentration, as opposed to other people with adhd that doesnt just have concentration issues, but also suffers from issues like time management, lack of motivation, depression and stuff.

Now you might be asking, "what the fuck kind of thing do you constantly think about then?". And im glad you asked because i have actually tried to see for myself, what all the things I end up thinking about are, and it could literally be anything, but here are the most common ones. Oh and also i guess todays video wont be too kid friendly so yeah, kids out there watching these vids, you have been warned. So, here all the thoughts that my brains keeps coming up with whenever I try to concentrate.
1. arguments I had with friends that i had in the past and coming up with better rebuttals
2. having sex, so libido.
3. catchy music that just starts playing in my head
4. ideas for a gag to use in my videos, or my music.
5. thinking about how to translate one word in one language to another
6. completely random thoughts, or feelings. by feelings, i mean the feeling of nostalgia or feeling of anger, and all those potent emotions, I would just randomly feel sometimes for no rhyme or reason.

these were some of the common ones, but it really could be about anything.
But what really matters about these random thoughts are that, it keeps coming up in my head in random intervals.
as I am writing this script right now, i got one kpop song that is stuck in my head, and after a few minutes of concentrating, now I have this song just playing in my head, and i just start humming alongside it. btw the song im referring to is 살짝설렜어나. 

because of these symptoms, my grades when i was in middle school, were abysmal. im talking like, a lot of Cs, Ds, and Fs. Once I got to high school, my grades got better basically because I actually tried to become better and put a lot of time into studying, and I ended up getting a lot of B+ and A-. 
Now you might be wondering, "sounds to me like your exaggerating your symptoms then, a lot of people with adhd struggle with grades and you seem like you did fine". and I do think that, my symptoms alone will probably not persuade anybody into thinking that I have adhd, esp with decent grades, but I do also think that, studying in high school comes down to short term memory, and I just had to spend more time memorizing things.

## My symptoms, explained a little further
i think the biggest problem with my symptoms is that, I am not able to retain all information that someone gives to me. So for example when a professor tells us the deadline for our assignments, or your boss tells you a deadline for your task, there is a very good chance that I wasnt paying attention when that info was given, and for normal people with a job, this really is not a big deal, unless that person is having a really rough day or something. 

~~i might not add this part~~
You might be asking though, "just ask one more time about the deadline if you didnt catch it then idiot"
and you would be right, but also I do think that just asking about deadline constantly or asking about whether the way i understand a task is correct or not, when done repeteadly, probably will hurt my reputation slowly. im not saying this alone will be a cause people to think im incapable, but if I were a manager that wants to promote somebody, i would probably give it to someone that is able to not ask about deadlines constantly.


## ADHD Meds
so i decided to get medicated for my concentration issues. but getting adhd medication in Korea is actually kind of more complex than compared to other countries like Japan, cuz in Japan I was just able to get adhd medication after filling out a paper form that took me 30 minutes to fill. In Korea on ther other hand, apparently people have been trying to get their hands on adhd meds because people thought it was some magical pill that increases concentration, so its harder to get your hands on them. Because of this, I was basically asked to provide more info about my young self, specifically i was asked to provide my (생활기록부) school records, but not because they want to see my grades, but because they want to see what my homeroom teachers had to say about me. Which honestly, i seriously doubt the authenticity of this kind procedure. Mainly because, if I do have adhd like I assume I do, I have the inattentive type of adhd. Which is to say that, you would not see me be hyperactive physically. instead, you might see me just sitting quietly, and you might see me make eye contact with you, making people believe that i am paying attention, when in reality i am often times just completely lost in my own train of thoughts, so the hyperactivity is happening in my brain and isnt projected physically through my body.
so, what happens next when the doctor sees my school records that probably just contain records about me that goes something like, "he's a nice but quiet kid with average grades", do I think the doc will be able to know that I have adhd from looking at those half ass records? No, prolly not. 
## School records
so i just actually was able to get my hands on the school records online from the Korean government website, and I only had to go through some authenticating and that was about it, which is one great thing about Koreans is that we usually do not like wasting our time. Anyways getting to see my own school records was honestly pretty friggin entertaining. i got to see my own picture when I was in elementary school and in middle school, or i guess for you 'muriacans its primary and secondary school. I actually physically had to shout at my own pictures because of how I looked ngl. When I do my face reveal video Im thinking I should definitely share my pics when i was young too so...yeah def hit that subscribe button haha <3 
So after checking out my school records, I noticed that, besides my horrible grades I had when I was in middle school (secondary school) between age 13 to 15, there was no real indication that my homeroom teachers wrote about my concentration. They mentioned things about, how im a nice kid but requires more diligence, how I seem to be capable but lacks grit and perseverance...all that kinda of stuff. But one of my homeroom teachers, the one I had in grade 9, that teacher actually did write in my school record how I seem to "lack concentration". I was pretty surprised knowing that there even was a teacher that analyzed me well enough to even realize that I did lack concentration. Normally I would imagine my homeroom teachers would just write down something like, hes a nice and quiet kid that seems to be smart, or something like that. I guess I did have really low grades at grade 9, but instead saying that I lacked perseverance and diligence like the other teachers, my grade 9 teacher actually wrote that I seem to lack focus. Dang I guess some teachers really do pay attention to their students.
So in any case, the chances of me getting adhd medication in Korea went from, not likely to, a maybe? thanks to my grade 9 teacher, so 김성안 선생님 감사합니다! ...though I seriously doubt she'll even come across this video 

## back toADHD meds
So back to ADHD meds. For me I kinda got lucky that I even found a record from school that mentions my lack of concentration at all. But this procedure to just get adhd medication still feels like its pretty stupid, and its there to make it harder for people to get meds. And its pretty much all thanks to a bunch of Korean assholes that would want to get adhd meds thinking that its some magical pill that guarantees better concentration.
honestly if there was a better way of figuring out if people have adhd or not i would def try that shit out. According to the one doctor I talked to recently in Korea, he said that there are no tests that works like a MRI scan, that can just tell you immeidately if you had adhd or not? But I distinctly remember how icecreamsandwich said something about a brain scan that actually do just that, tell you if you have adhd and shit. But when I asked this doctor, he said no there is no such thing, not even other countries like the US...?? and thats when I started seriously doubt this doctor cuz he kinda seemed like hes just making shit up now.
after some researching online, the brain scan that icecreamsandwich talked about is called an EEG test, and its a test that can help diagnose adhd, but some studies show cast some doubts on its legitimacy? So... maybe the doctor isnt completely wrong?
But whatever, the point is that, for me to get meds right now, I need to show him my stupid school records.
and you know what happened after I showed him my school records? He did end up giving me the meds...fucking finally.

So now I am taking concerta, which is supposed to be a stimulant. There are two major adhd meds that you can acquire in Korea as of 2024, one is concerta, a stimulant med, and the other is straterra, which is a non-stimulant like vyvanse which is more mellow. so a non-stimulant tends to have less side effects but might take longer for the effects to start showing up. Concerta does still release its juice within a longer time span compared to something like adderall. And of course adderall is banned in Korea since it is very similar to meth and in Korea basically any drugs with the slightest chance of abusing are usually not available.

Ive only recently started taking concerta so, and so far it doesnt have an effect at all, making me think that maybe it really isnt adhd that I have, and is instead just me being just being a person that gets easily distracted with a short attention span. Which would also make perfect sense, and all I want is to just be able to fix my problem of concentration which Im sure will bite me in the ass pretty hard once i start to work in an actual company.

(this gag might be a better for when I need an example of me being a complete dumbass.)oh yeah maybe that one time I completely forgot that its August this month and I started saying that its July?? wtf lol
like this one time that I forgot that this month is August, and I completely started thinking that this month is July? And my big brother was like uh...dude your joking right? Its July this month. and I was like...WHAT
