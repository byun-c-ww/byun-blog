  content: "My name is Byun Cheolyeon, 27 as of writing this, and I am an aspiring Devops / Cloud Engineer! I was born and raised in South Korea, and studied in a Japanese University called Waseda located in Shinjuku, Tokyo. I ended up learning mostly data science related stuff, with fine tuning language models and whatnot, though frankly I'm almost positive I only ever pretended that I understood what the heck those things were about. But it did make me learn that I am quite passionate about tech related stuff, and I ended up getting a job in AWS Ireland as a Cloud Support Engineer! I get to work in their Japanese team, starting April of 2025!"
